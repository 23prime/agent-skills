# Concurrency

## Share by communicating

Concurrent programming in many environments is made difficult by the subtleties required to implement correct access to shared variables. Go encourages a different approach in which shared values are passed around on channels and, in fact, never actively shared by separate threads of execution. Only one goroutine has access to the value at any given time. Data races cannot occur, by design. To encourage this way of thinking we have reduced it to a slogan:

> Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

This approach can be taken too far. Reference counts may be best done by putting a mutex around an integer variable, for instance. But as a high-level approach, using channels to control access makes it easier to write clear, correct programs.

One way to think about this model is to consider a typical single-threaded program running on one CPU. It has no need for synchronization primitives. Now run another such instance; it too needs no synchronization. Now let those two communicate; if the communication is the synchronizer, there's still no need for other synchronization. Unix pipelines, for example, fit this model perfectly. Although Go's approach to concurrency originates in Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), it can also be seen as a type-safe generalization of Unix pipes.

## Goroutines

They're called *goroutines* because the existing terms—threads, coroutines, processes, and so on—convey inaccurate connotations. A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing concurrently with other goroutines in the same address space. It is lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.

Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run. Their design hides many of the complexities of thread creation and management.

Prefix a function or method call with the `go` keyword to run the call in a new goroutine. When the call completes, the goroutine exits, silently.

```go
go list.Sort()  // run list.Sort concurrently; don't wait for it.
```

A function literal can be handy in a goroutine invocation.

```go
func Announce(message string, delay time.Duration) {
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(delay)
        fmt.Println(message)
    }()  // Note the parentheses - must call the function.
}
```

In Go, function literals are closures: the implementation makes sure the variables referred to by the function survive as long as they are active.

These examples aren't too practical because the functions have no way of signaling completion. For that, we need channels.

## Channels

Like maps, channels are allocated with `make`, and the resulting value acts as a reference to an underlying data structure. If an optional integer parameter is provided, it sets the buffer size for the channel. The default is zero, for an unbuffered or synchronous channel.

```go
ci := make(chan int)            // unbuffered channel of integers
cj := make(chan int, 0)         // unbuffered channel of integers
cs := make(chan *os.File, 100)  // buffered channel of pointers to Files
```

Unbuffered channels combine communication—the exchange of a value—with synchronization—guaranteeing that two calculations (goroutines) are in a known state.

There are lots of nice idioms using channels. Here's one to get us started. A channel can allow the launching goroutine to wait for the sort to complete.

```go
c := make(chan int)  // Allocate a channel.
// Start the sort in a goroutine; when it completes, signal on the channel.
go func() {
    list.Sort()
    c <- 1  // Send a signal; value does not matter.
}()
doSomethingForAWhile()
<-c   // Wait for sort to finish; discard sent value.
```

Receivers always block until there is data to receive. If the channel is unbuffered, the sender blocks until the receiver has received the value. If the channel has a buffer, the sender blocks only until the value has been copied to the buffer; if the buffer is full, this means waiting until some receiver has retrieved a value.

A buffered channel can be used like a semaphore, for instance to limit throughput:

```go
var sem = make(chan int, MaxOutstanding)

func handle(r *Request) {
    sem <- 1    // Wait for active queue to drain.
    process(r)  // May take a long time.
    <-sem       // Done; enable next request to run.
}

func Serve(queue chan *Request) {
    for {
        req := <-queue
        go handle(req)  // Don't wait for handle to finish.
    }
}
```

This design has a problem, though: `Serve` creates a new goroutine for every incoming request, even though only `MaxOutstanding` of them can run at any moment. We can address that deficiency by changing `Serve` to gate the creation of the goroutines:

```go
func Serve(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        sem <- 1
        go func() {
            process(req)
            <-sem
        }()
    }
}
```

Another approach that manages resources well is to start a fixed number of `handle` goroutines all reading from the request channel:

```go
func handle(queue chan *Request) {
    for r := range queue {
        process(r)
    }
}

func Serve(clientRequests chan *Request, quit chan bool) {
    // Start handlers
    for i := 0; i < MaxOutstanding; i++ {
        go handle(clientRequests)
    }
    <-quit  // Wait to be told to exit.
}
```

## Channels of channels

One of the most important properties of Go is that a channel is a first-class value that can be allocated and passed around like any other. A common use of this property is to implement safe, parallel demultiplexing.

If that type includes a channel on which to reply, each client can provide its own path for the answer:

```go
type Request struct {
    args        []int
    f           func([]int) int
    resultChan  chan int
}
```

The client provides a function and its arguments, as well as a channel inside the request object on which to receive the answer.

```go
func sum(a []int) (s int) {
    for _, v := range a {
        s += v
    }
    return
}

request := &Request{[]int{3, 4, 5}, sum, make(chan int)}
// Send request
clientRequests <- request
// Wait for response.
fmt.Printf("answer: %d\n", <-request.resultChan)
```

On the server side, the handler function is the only thing that changes.

```go
func handle(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        req.resultChan <- req.f(req.args)
    }
}
```

## Parallelization

Another application of these ideas is to parallelize a calculation across multiple CPU cores. If the calculation can be broken into separate pieces that can execute independently, it can be parallelized, with a channel to signal when each piece completes.

```go
type Vector []float64

// Apply the operation to v[i], v[i+1] ... up to v[n-1].
func (v Vector) DoSome(i, n int, u Vector, c chan int) {
    for ; i < n; i++ {
        v[i] += u.Op(v[i])
    }
    c <- 1    // signal that this piece is done
}
```

We launch the pieces independently in a loop, one per CPU:

```go
const numCPU = 4 // number of CPU cores

func (v Vector) DoAll(u Vector) {
    c := make(chan int, numCPU)  // Buffering optional but sensible.
    for i := 0; i < numCPU; i++ {
        go v.DoSome(i*len(v)/numCPU, (i+1)*len(v)/numCPU, u, c)
    }
    // Drain the channel.
    for i := 0; i < numCPU; i++ {
        <-c    // wait for one task to complete
    }
    // All done.
}
```

Rather than create a constant value for numCPU, we can ask the runtime what value is appropriate:

```go
var numCPU = runtime.NumCPU()
```

There is also a function `runtime.GOMAXPROCS()`, which reports (or sets) the user-specified number of cores that a Go program can have running simultaneously:

```go
var numCPU = runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)
```

Be sure not to confuse the ideas of concurrency—structuring a program as independently executing components—and parallelism—executing calculations in parallel for efficiency on multiple CPUs. Although the concurrency features of Go can make some problems easy to structure as parallel computations, Go is a concurrent language, not a parallel one, and not all parallelization problems fit Go's model.

## A leaky buffer

The tools of concurrent programming can even make non-concurrent ideas easier to express. Here's an example abstracted from an RPC package. The client goroutine loops receiving data from some source, perhaps a network. To avoid allocating and freeing buffers, it keeps a free list, and uses a buffered channel to represent it:

```go
var freeList = make(chan *Buffer, 100)
var serverChan = make(chan *Buffer)

func client() {
    for {
        var b *Buffer
        // Grab a buffer if available; allocate if not.
        select {
        case b = <-freeList:
            // Got one; nothing more to do.
        default:
            // None free, so allocate a new one.
            b = new(Buffer)
        }
        load(b)              // Read next message from the net.
        serverChan <- b      // Send to server.
    }
}
```

The server loop receives each message from the client, processes it, and returns the buffer to the free list.

```go
func server() {
    for {
        b := <-serverChan    // Wait for work.
        process(b)
        // Reuse buffer if there's room.
        select {
        case freeList <- b:
            // Buffer on free list; nothing more to do.
        default:
            // Free list full, just carry on.
        }
    }
}
```

The client attempts to retrieve a buffer from `freeList`; if none is available, it allocates a fresh one. The server's send to `freeList` puts `b` back on the free list unless the list is full, in which case the buffer is dropped on the floor to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. (The `default` clauses in the `select` statements execute when no other case is ready, meaning that the `selects` never block.) This implementation builds a leaky bucket free list in just a few lines, relying on the buffered channel and the garbage collector for bookkeeping.
