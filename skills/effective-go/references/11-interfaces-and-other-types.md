# Interfaces and other types

## Interfaces

Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an object: if something can do *this*, then it can be used *here*. We've seen a couple of simple examples already; custom printers can be implemented by a `String` method while `Fprintf` can generate output to anything with a `Write` method. Interfaces with only one or two methods are common in Go code, and are usually given a name derived from the method, such as `io.Writer` for something that implements `Write`.

A type can implement multiple interfaces. For instance, a collection can be sorted by the routines in package `sort` if it implements `sort.Interface`, which contains `Len()`, `Less(i, j int) bool`, and `Swap(i, j int)`, and it could also have a custom formatter. In this contrived example `Sequence` satisfies both.

```go
type Sequence []int

// Methods required by sort.Interface.
func (s Sequence) Len() int {
    return len(s)
}
func (s Sequence) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return s[i] < s[j]
}
func (s Sequence) Swap(i, j int) {
    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
}

// Copy returns a copy of the Sequence.
func (s Sequence) Copy() Sequence {
    copy := make(Sequence, 0, len(s))
    return append(copy, s...)
}

// Method for printing - sorts the elements before printing.
func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy() // Make a copy; don't overwrite argument.
    sort.Sort(s)
    str := "["
    for i, elem := range s { // Loop is O(N²); will fix that in next example.
        if i > 0 {
            str += " "
        }
        str += fmt.Sprint(elem)
    }
    return str + "]"
}
```

## Conversions

The `String` method of `Sequence` is recreating the work that `Sprint` already does for slices. We can share the effort (and also speed it up) if we convert the `Sequence` to a plain `[]int` before calling `Sprint`.

```go
func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy()
    sort.Sort(s)
    return fmt.Sprint([]int(s))
}
```

This method is another example of the conversion technique for calling `Sprintf` safely from a `String` method. Because the two types (`Sequence` and `[]int`) are the same if we ignore the type name, it's legal to convert between them. The conversion doesn't create a new value, it just temporarily acts as though the existing value has a new type.

It's an idiom in Go programs to convert the type of an expression to access a different set of methods. As an example, we could use the existing type `sort.IntSlice` to reduce the entire example to this:

```go
type Sequence []int

// Method for printing - sorts the elements before printing
func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy()
    sort.IntSlice(s).Sort()
    return fmt.Sprint([]int(s))
}
```

## Interface conversions and type assertions

Type switches are a form of conversion: they take an interface and, for each case in the switch, in a sense convert it to the type of that case. Here's a simplified version of how the code under `fmt.Printf` turns a value into a string using a type switch:

```go
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

var value interface{} // Value provided by caller.
switch str := value.(type) {
case string:
    return str
case Stringer:
    return str.String()
}
```

What if there's only one type we care about? A one-case type switch would do, but so would a *type assertion*. A type assertion takes an interface value and extracts from it a value of the specified explicit type:

```go
value.(typeName)
```

To guard against a panic, use the "comma, ok" idiom to test safely:

```go
str, ok := value.(string)
if ok {
    fmt.Printf("string value is: %q\n", str)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("value is not a string\n")
}
```

If the type assertion fails, `str` will still exist and be of type string, but it will have the zero value, an empty string.

## Generality

If a type exists only to implement an interface and will never have exported methods beyond that interface, there is no need to export the type itself. Exporting just the interface makes it clear the value has no interesting behavior beyond what is described in the interface. It also avoids the need to repeat the documentation on every instance of a common method.

In such cases, the constructor should return an interface value rather than the implementing type. As an example, in the hash libraries both `crc32.NewIEEE` and `adler32.New` return the interface type `hash.Hash32`. Substituting the CRC-32 algorithm for Adler-32 in a Go program requires only changing the constructor call; the rest of the code is unaffected by the change of algorithm.

A similar approach allows the streaming cipher algorithms in the various `crypto` packages to be separated from the block ciphers they chain together:

```go
type Block interface {
    BlockSize() int
    Encrypt(dst, src []byte)
    Decrypt(dst, src []byte)
}

type Stream interface {
    XORKeyStream(dst, src []byte)
}
```

`NewCTR` applies not just to one specific encryption algorithm and data source but to any implementation of the `Block` interface and any `Stream`. Because they return interface values, replacing CTR encryption with other encryption modes is a localized change.
